**Item & Block Holograms**

I'm happy to introduce item and block holograms in FancyHolograms 2.0.3 - one most requested feature since the first version.

Until now you could only create text holograms with FancyHolograms, but starting with v2.0.3 you are also able to create holograms with a different type.

How to create item & block holograms?
The create commands has changed a little bit: /hologram create (text|block|item) (hologram name)
Each hologram and only be of one type: text, block or item. You can not have items inside a text hologram (but you can create two holograms and move the item hologram over the text hologram).

How to modify item and block holograms?
There are two new commands:

/hologram edit (hologram) item
(execute this command while holding an item of your choice in your main hand.)

/hologram edit (hologram) block (block type)

Billboard, scale, rotation etc.

You are able to change the billboard, scale, position, shadow and rotaion of all hologram types (text, item and block)

How to migrate from a older version of FancyHolograms?

1. stop the server
2. take a backup of your server and FancyHolograms folder
3. replace the old FancyHolograms jar with the new one
4. start the server
5. done!

I hope you will enjoy the new big feature! I can't wait to see what you are going to do with the new hologram types.
