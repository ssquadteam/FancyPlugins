# FancyVisuals

**Do not use this plugin in production! It is still in development and may contain bugs and unfinished features.**

This is a plugin to customise most visual components of your minecraft server. This includes the scoreboard, tablist,
bossbar, actionbar, title, chat and nametags. This plugin is highly customisable and can be used to create a unique
experience for your players.
This plugin is packet based (powered by FancySitula), meaning it is blazing fast and has no impact on server
performance. You can use placeholders by PlaceholderAPI anywhere in the plugin.

## Features

The plugin is divided into multiple modules, each of which can be configured individually.

### Nametags

- With the nametags module, you can customise the nametags (text above the player's head) of players
- The nametags are implemented using display entities
- The nametags can have multiple lines and a configurable background
- You can use MiniMessage for coloring and formatting
- Placeholders by PlaceholderAPI are supported
